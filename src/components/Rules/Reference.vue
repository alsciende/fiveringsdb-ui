            <p>
                This document is intended as the definitive source for rules information, but does not teach players how to play the game. Players should first read the Learn to Play book in its entirety and use this Rules Reference as needed while playing the game.</p>
            <p>
                The majority of this guide consists of the glossary, which provides an alphabetical listing of terms and situations a player might encounter during a game. This section should be the first destination for players who have a rules question.</p>
            <p>
                The latter part of this guide contains two appendices. The first appendix provides detailed timing diagrams that illustrate the structure of an entire game round, as well as how to handle each game step presented in those diagrams. The second provides a detailed anatomy of each card type.</p>

                If the text of this Rules Reference directly contradicts the text of the Learn to Play book, the text of the Rules Reference takes precedence.</p>
            <p>
                If the text of a card directly contradicts the text of either the Rules Reference or the Learn to play book, the text of the card takes precedence.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="1">Glossary</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                The following is an alphabetical list of entries for game rules, terms, and situations that may occur during play.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Ability</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                An ability is the special game text that a card contributes to the game. Card abilities fall into one of the following types: actions, constant abilities, interrupts, keywords, and reactions. Some interrupt and reaction abilities are also forced.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Card abilities only interact with, and can only target, cards that are in play, unless the ability specifically refers to an out-of-play area or element. Card abilities on characters, attachments, holdings, strongholds, and provinces can only be initiated or affect the game while they are in play unless the ability specifically refers to being used from an out-of-play area, or require that the card be out of play for the ability to resolve. Event cards and role cards implicitly interact with the game from an out-of-play area, as established by the rules of their cardtypes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The application or initiation of the following types of abilities is mandatory: constant abilities, forced interrupt abilities, and forced reaction abilities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The initiation of any keyword which uses the word "may" in its keyword description is optional. The application of all other keywords is mandatory.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The initiation of action, interrupt, and reaction abilities is optional. The word "may" also incorporates a player option into the resolution of an ability. The player who controls the card on which an optional ability exists determines whether or not he or she wishes to use that ability at the appropriate time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An ability prefaced by a bold-face timing trigger followed by a colon is referred to as a "triggered ability."
                </li>
                <li>
                    The controller of the card from which an ability is resolving makes all decisions required by that ability's resolution unless another player is specifed by the ability's text.
                </li>

            <p>An action ability is a triggered card ability that contains the boldface "<b>Action:</b>" precursor. An action ability may be triggered by its controller during any action window (see <a
                    href="#appendix-i-timing-and-gameplay">"Appendix I: Timing and Gameplay"</a> on page 18).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unless otherwise noted by the ability, each action ability may be initiated only once each round.
                </li>
                <li>An action that has been initiated must be resolved before the next action can be initiated.</li>

            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Active Player</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                In some phases, the game creates an active player, who is granted permission to perform a specified task.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    During the dynasty phase, the active player is the player who is permitted to play character cards from his or her provinces or initiate an action ability. The status of active player alternates between players in this phase until one player passes, after which the remaining player remains the active player until he or she also passes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    During the conflict phase, the active player is the player with the opportunity to initiate a conflict, or the player who is resolving a conflict he or she has initiated.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Against</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                During a conflict, the attacking player and the defending player are considered to be taking part in the conflict against each other.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Ancestral</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                Ancestral is a keyword ability that appears on attachments. If the card or game element to which an ancestral attachment is attached leaves play, the ancestral attachment is returned to its owner's hand instead of being discarded.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Attachment Cards</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                Attachment cards represent weapons, armor, items, skills, spells, conditions, and titles. An attachment card enters play ready and attached to another card or game element, and remains in play unless it is removed by an ability, or unless the attached card leaves play.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    An attachment cannot enter play if there is no eligible card or game element to which it can attach.
                </li>
                <li>An attachment can only attach to a character, unless otherwise specified by the attachment's text.
                </li>
                <li>There is no limit on the number of attachments that may be attached to a card or game element.</li>
                <li>If the card to which an attachment is attached leaves play, simultaneously discard the attachment.
                </li>
                <li>If a situation arises in which an attachment is not legally attached, discard the attachment.</li>
                <li>
                    An attachment a player controls remains under his or her control even if the card or game element to which it is attached is under an opponent's control.
                </li>
                <li>An attachment card bows and readies independently of the card to which it is attached.</li>
                <li>
                    If an attachment has skill modifiers, those modifiers apply to the skill of the attached character. Such modifiers apply to the character even while the attachment is bowed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a character card is in play as an attachment, the skill values on that character-as-attachment are not treated as skill modifiers (as they lack the "+" or "-" symbol before the value) for the character to which the card is attached.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For attachment card anatomy, see "<a href="#appendix-ii-card-anatomy">Appendix II: Card Anatomy</a>" on page 24.
            </p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Attacker, Attacking Character, Attacking Player</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                The term "attacking character" refers to a character that is participating in a conflict on the side of the player who initiated the conflict. The term "attacker" is also used as shorthand for "attacking character."</p>
            <p>
                The term "attacking player" refers to the player that initiated the conflict that is currently resolving.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Base Value</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                The value of a quantity before other modifiers are applied. For most quantities, it is also the printed value.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Bid Value</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                If the value of an honor bid is modified, resolve that bid as if the modified value is that player's bid. The value of a bid may exceed five (the highest number on the honor dial), or may be reduced to zero.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When the value of an honor bid is modified, the setting on the dial is not itself adjusted.</li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Blank</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                If an ability causes a card's printed text box to be considered "blank," that text box is treated as if it did not have any of its printed <i>Traits</i>
                or card abilities. Text gained from another source is not blanked.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Breaking a Province, Broken Province</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                If the attacking player wins a conflict with a total skill difference (between the attacking player and the defending player) equal to or greater than the defense strength of the attacked province, the province breaks.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rotate a broken province 180 degrees to indicate it is broken.</li>
                <li>
                    When a province is broken, the attacking player has the option of discarding any dynasty cards in that province. If this option is taken, the province is refilled facedown.
                </li>
                <li>Ability text on a broken province is not active.</li>
                <li>
                    Dynasty cards may still be played from broken provinces, and broken provinces still refill following the standard game rules.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If three of a player's non-stronghold provinces are broken, attacks may be declared against that player's stronghold. If a player's stronghold province is broken, that player loses the game.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Bow, Bowed</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                Cards often bow after participating in a conflict, to use card abilities, or as the result of card or game effects. When a card is bowed, it is rotated 90 degrees. A card in this latter state is considered bowed.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A bowed card cannot bow again until it is ready. Cards are typically readied by a game step or card ability.
                </li>
                <li>During conflicts, bowed characters do not contribute their skill.</li>
                <li>A bowed attachment with skill modifiers still modifies the skill of the attached character.</li>
                <li>
                    A card ability on a bowed card is active and can still engage with the game state. However, if a bowed card must bow as part of its cost to trigger an ability, it cannot bow again until it is readied, so the ability could not be triggered.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Cancel</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                Some card abilities can "cancel" other card or game effects. Cancel abilities interrupt the initiation of an effect, and prevent the effect from initiating. Because of this, cancel abilities have timing priority over <i>all</i>
                other interrupts to the effect that is attempting to initiate.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If an effect is canceled, that effect is no longer imminent, and further interrupts (including cancels) cannot be initiated in reference to the canceled effect.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the effects of an ability are canceled, the ability is still considered to have been used, and any costs have still been paid.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the effects of an event card are canceled, the card is still considered to have been played, and it is still placed in its owner's discard pile.
                </li>
                <li>If a ring effect that is resolving for winning a conflict is canceled, the ring is still claimed.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Cannot</anchored-heading>
            <p>The word "cannot" is absolute, and cannot be countermanded by other abilities or effects.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Cardtypes</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                The game's cardtypes are: character, attachment, holding, event, province, stronghold, and role. Each of these cardtypes, with a detailed card anatomy, is presented in "<a
                    href="#appendix-ii-card-anatomy">Appendix II: Card Anatomy</a>" on page 24.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If an ability causes a card to change its cardtype, the card loses all other cardtypes it might possess and functions as would any card of the new cardtype.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Challenge</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                Some card abilities use the word "challenge" to initiate a duel between two characters participating in a conflict. For the rules on how to resolve a duel, see "<a
                    href="#duel-timing">Duel timing</a>" on page 23.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Character Cards</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                Character cards represent the bushi, courtiers, shugenja, monks, shinobi, armies, creatures, and other personalities and groups one might encounter in Rokugan.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Character cards generally enter play ready and in a player's home area, and remain in play unless removed by an ability or game step.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When a player plays a character from his or her hand during a conflict, the player has the option to play it directly into the conflict, ready and participating on his or her side.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For character card anatomy, see "<a href="#appendix-ii-card-anatomy">Appendix II: Card Anatomy</a>" on page 24.
            </p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Choose</anchored-heading>
            <p>The word "choose" indicates that one or more targets must be chosen in order to resolve an ability.</p>

            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Clan</anchored-heading>
            <p>There are 7 clans in the core set, as depicted in the chart below.</p>
            <p>
                A player's stronghold card signals which clan a player has chosen as the primary clan for his or her deck. The clans and their associated symbols are listed below.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    An "in-clan" card bears a clan symbol that matches the clan symbol on its controller's stronghold card.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An "out-of-clan" card bears one or more clan symbols that do not match the clan symbol on its controller's stronghold card, and does not bear a clan symbol that matches the clan symbol on its controller's stronghold card.

            <p>
                A constant ability is any non-keyword ability whose text contains no boldface timing trigger defining its ability type. A constant ability becomes active as soon as its card enters play and remains active while the card is in play.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Some constant abilities continuously seek a specific condition (denoted by words such as "during," "if," or "while"). The effects of such abilities are active any time the specified condition is met.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If multiple instances of the same constant ability are in play, each instance affects the game state independently.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Control and Ownership</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                A card's owner is the player who included the card as a part of his or her deck (i.e. dynasty deck, conflict deck, provinces, stronghold, role) at the beginning of the game.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    By default, cards enter play under their owner's control. Some abilities may cause cards to change control during a game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A player controls the cards in his or her out-of-play game areas (such as the hand, the dynasty and conflict decks, and the dynasty and conflict discard piles).
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a card would enter an out-of-play area of a player who does not own the card, the card is placed in its owner's equivalent out-of-play area instead. (For all associated card ability and framework effect purposes, the card is considered to have entered that opponent's out-of-play area, and only the physical placement of the card is adjusted.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a participating character changes control during a conflict, it is considered participating in the same conflict on the side of its new controller.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When a character changes control while it is in play, it remains in the same state as it was before (i.e., bowed or ready, participating or at home, etc.), and is now under the new player's control.
                </li>
                <li>Attachments on a card that changes control do not themselves change control.</li>
                <li>Unless a duration is specified, a control change persists as long as the card remains in play.</li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Copy (of a card)</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                A copy of a card is defined by title: any other card that shares the same title is considered a copy, regardless of cardtype, text, deck of origin, artwork, or any other characteristic(s) of the card(s).</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Cost</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                A card's fate cost is the numerical value that must be paid to play the card from a player's hand or provinces.</p>
            <p>
                Some triggered card abilities also have an ability cost. Any imperative instruction (other than "choose...," which denotes one or more targets must be chosen) that appears before the dash of a triggered ability is considered a part of that ability's cost. Some examples of ability cost instructions are: "Bow...," "Spend...," "Sacrifice...," "Lose...," "Dishonor...," and "Discard...."</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When a player is paying a cost, the payment must be made with cards and/or game elements that player controls. The word "friendly" is used as a reminder of this in some costs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a cost requires a game element that is not in play, the player paying the cost may only use game elements that are in his or her out-of-play areas or token pools to pay the cost.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If multiple costs for a single card or ability require payment, those costs must be paid simultaneously.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If any part of a cost payment is prevented, once all costs that can be paid are paid, the process of initiating the ability or playing the card immediately ends without further resolution. (If this occurs while playing a card, the card remains unplayed in its owner's hand or province.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    An ability cannot initiate (and therefore its costs cannot be paid) if its effect on its own does not have the potential to change the game state.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Count</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                When instructed to count a total of game values on a subset of characters, values on bowed characters are not counted.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Courtesy</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                Courtesy is a keyword ability. When a card with the courtesy keyword leaves play, its controller gains 1 fate.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Covert</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                Covert is a keyword ability. When a player initiates a conflict, for each character with the covert keyword he or she declares as an attacker, that player may choose one character without covert controlled by the defending player. Each chosen character is considered evaded by covert, and cannot be declared as a defender for that conflict.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Card abilities may be used to move characters that have been evaded by covert into a conflict as defenders.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Covert may only be used when characters are declared as attackers. If a character with covert is moved into or played into a conflict after the point at which the conflict was declared, that character's covert ability does not resolve.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Current</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                If an ability references a "current" skill or glory count, use the players' applicable specified totals at the time the ability resolves.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Dash (&ndash;)</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                In the text of a triggered ability, a dash (&ndash;) is used to separate the criteria that are necessary to use the ability from the effect of the ability. Any triggering conditions, play restrictions or permissions, costs, and targeting requirements are denoted before the dash. The ability's effect is denoted after the dash.</p>
            <p>
                If a character has a dash (&ndash;) for a skill value, that character cannot participate in conflicts of that type.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Should a character with a dash skill value somehow end up participating in a conflict of the corresponding type, that character is immediately removed from the conflict, and placed in its controller's home area in a bowed state.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a character has a dash for a skill value, that skill value cannot be modified or otherwise changed by card abilities and effects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a skill value for a dash character is required to resolve a card ability, treat the card as if it had an unmodifiable skill value of 0.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A character with a dash skill value cannot be a challenger or challengee in a duel of that skill type. (see <a
                        href="#duel-timing">D.2</a> on page 23).

                <li>
                    A player's set of provinces must include exactly 5 provinces, consisting of exactly 1 province associated with each ring. (Each province has a ring symbol in the lower right corner of the card to indicate its association.) Each of these provinces must be in-clan or be neutral.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>

            </ul>
            <p><b>Note:</b>
                When constructing a dynasty and conflict deck for out-of-the-box play from one core set, the minimum size for each deck is 30 cards. To construct decks for two players from a single core set, use all the cards and influence from the desired clan pairings and divide the neutrals as in the tutorial game.

            <p>
                Up to 3 total copies of most cards (by title) may be included in a player's dynasty and/or conflict decks. Each copy of a card in either deck counts towards this limit.</p>
            <p>
                If a card has the text "Deck limit X" no more than X copies of that card may be included in that player's dynasty and/or conflict decks.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If X is 2 or lower, this phrase acts as a deckbuilding restriction.</li>
                <li>
                    If X is 4 or higher, this phrase acts as a permission that enables a player to include more than the standard 3 copies.

            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Defender, Defending Character, Defending Player</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                The term "defending character" refers to a character that is participating in a conflict on the side of the player who controls the province that is being attacked. The term "defender" is also used as shorthand for "defending character."</p>
            <p>
                The term "defending player" refers to the opponent of the attacking player against whom (from the attacking player's perspective) a conflict is resolving.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Delayed Effects</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                Some abilities contain delayed effects. Such abilities specify a future timing point, or indicate a future condition that may arise, and dictate an effect that is to happen at that time.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Delayed effects resolve automatically and immediately after their specified timing point or future condition occurs or becomes true, before reactions to that moment may be triggered.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When a delayed effect resolves, it is not treated as a new triggered ability, even if the delayed effect was originally created by a triggered ability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When a delayed resolves, it is still considered to be an ability originating from the cardtype of the card that created the delayed effect.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Any time a card is discarded (from play, or from an out-of-play area such as a hand or deck), it is placed faceup on top of its owner's appropriate discard pile: dynasty cards are discarded to the dynasty discard pile, and conflict cards are discarded to the conflict discard pile.
                </li>
                <li>Each player's discard pile is open information, and may be looked at by any player at any time.</li>
                <li>
                    The order of cards in a discard pile may not be altered unless a player is instructed to do so by a card ability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If multiple cards are discarded simultaneously, the owner of the cards chooses the order in which those cards are placed in the discard pile.

            <p>
                A card effect is any effect that arises from the resolution of ability text printed on or gained by a card. A framework effect is any effect that arises from the resolution of a framework step.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Card effects might be preceded by costs, triggering conditions, play restrictions or permissions, and/or targeting requirements. Such elements are not considered effects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once an ability is initiated, players must resolve as much of each aspect of its effect as they are able, unless the effect uses the word "may."
                </li>
                <li>
                    When a non-targeting effect attempts to engage a number of entities (such as "search the top 10 cards of your conflict deck") that exceeds the number of entities that currently exist in the specified game area, the effect engages as many entities as possible.

                <li>
                    The expiration of a lasting effect (or the cessation of a constant ability) is not considered to be generating a game state change by a card effect.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If an ability instructs a player to select among multiple effects, an effect that has the potential to change the game state must be selected.

            <p>
                The phrase "enters play" refers to any time a card makes a transition from an out-of-play area or state into play. Playing a card and putting a card into play by using a card ability are two means by which a card may enter play.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Event Cards</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                Event cards represent tactical acts and maneuvers, court intrigues, spells, supernatural occurrences, and other unexpected developments that might occur during a game.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Event cards are triggered from a player's hand. An event card's ability type, triggering condition (if any), and play permissions/restrictions (if any) define when and how the card may be played.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When an event card is played, its costs are paid, its effects are resolved (or canceled), and it is placed in its owner's discard pile prior to opening the reaction window which follows the ability's resolution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Event cards engage the game state at the time they resolve. If an event card creates a lasting effect on a set of cards, only cards that are in play (or in the affected game area or game state) at the time the event is played are eligible to be affected. Cards that enter play (or the affected game area or game state) after the resolution of the event are not affected by its lasting effect.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the effects of an event card are canceled, the card is still considered to have been played, and its costs remain paid, and the card is still discarded. Only the effects have been canceled.
                </li>

            <p>
                Fate is the game's basic resource, and is used to pay for cards and some card abilities. The amount of fate a player has available at any given time is represented (as open information) by fate tokens in his or her fate pool.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Fate begins the game in the general token pool. When a player gains fate, that player takes that much fate from the general token pool and adds it to his or her fate pool.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When a player is instructed to place fate on a card, that fate comes from the general token pool unless otherwise specified.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When fate is spent or lost, it is usually returned to the general token pool. If fate is spent to a ring, it is placed on that ring.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whenever a player plays a character from his or her hand or provinces, after paying the character's cost, that player has the option of placing any number of fate from his or her fate pool onto that character.
                </li>
                <li>
                    During the fate phase, each character with no fate on it is discarded. Subsequently, 1 fate is removed from each character in play. Finally, 1 fate from the general token pool is placed on each unclaimed ring.

                When the players are asked to count glory, each player counts the total glory value among the ready characters he or she controls, and adds 1 to the total for each ring in his or her claimed ring pool. The player with the highest total wins the glory count.</p>

                Influence is a deckbuilding resource that is indicated by a player's chosen stronghold for that deck. Many conflict deck cards have an influence cost, which makes them eligible for selection as an out-of-clan card.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A player may spend influence up to the amount indicated by his or her stronghold to include out-of-clan cards from a <i>single</i>
                    additional clan in his or her conflict deck.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each copy of a card that is chosen reduces the amount of influence a player has at his or her disposal to use in selecting other cards for the deck.

                <li>
                    A clan-affiliated card that has no influence cost cannot be selected using influence for inclusion in a deck.

Tom decides to include 3 copies of Admit Defeat (2 influence cost each), 3 copies of The Perfect Gift (1 influence cost each), and 1 copy of Duelist Training (1 influence cost). As this is all of Tom's influence, he cannot include any other Crane Clan cards in his conflict deck.

                <li>
                    Determine the cost (or costs, if multiple costs are required) to play the card or initiate the ability. If it is established that the cost (taking modifiers into account) can be paid, proceed with the remaining steps of this sequence.

            <p>
                If the players are instructed to perform a sequence "in player order," the first player performs his or her part of the sequence first, followed by the other player.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If a sequence performed in player order does not conclude after each player has performed his or her aspect of the sequence once, the sequence of opportunities continues to alternate back and forth between the players until it is complete.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Interrupts</anchored-heading>
            <p>An interrupt is a triggered ability whose text is prefaced by a boldface "<b>Interrupt:</b>" precursor. An interrupt ability interrupts the resolution of its triggering condition, sometimes canceling or changing the resolution of that condition. Always resolve interrupts to a triggering condition before resolving the consequences of the triggering condition itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike actions, which are resolved during action windows, an interrupt may be initiated only if its specified triggering condition occurs, as described in the interrupt ability's text.</p>
            <p>
                When a triggering condition initiates (but before it completes its resolution), an interrupt window for that triggering condition opens.</p>
            <p>
                Within the interrupt window, the first player always has the first opportunity to initiate an eligible interrupt (to the triggering condition that opened the window), or pass. Opportunities to initiate an eligible interrupt, or pass, continue to alternate between the players until all players consecutively pass, at which point the interrupt window closes. Passing does not prevent a player from initiating an eligible interrupt later in that same interrupt window.</p>
            <p>
                Once an interrupt window closes, further interrupts to that specific triggering condition cannot be initiated. The triggering condition now completes its resolution (as long as its effects have not been canceled).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Unless otherwise noted by the ability, each interrupt ability may be initiated once each round. (This includes forced interrupts.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    An interrupt with specified limit that enables it to be triggered more than once per round may only be initiated once each time its specified triggering condition occurs.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Keywords</anchored-heading>
            <p>A keyword is a card ability which conveys specific rules to its card. The keywords in the core set are:	<a
                    href="#ancestral">Ancestral</a>,
                <a href="#courtesy">Courtesy</a>,

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Sometimes a keyword is followed by reminder text, which is presented in italics. Reminder text is a shorthand explanation of how a keyword works, but it is not rules text and does not replace the rules for that keyword in this glossary.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A card is considered to have a keyword or to not have that keyword. A single card that has and/or is gaining the same keyword from multiple sources functions as if it has one instance of that keyword.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Lasting Effects</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                Some abilities create conditions that affect the game state for a specified duration. Such effects are known as lasting effects.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A lasting effect persists beyond the resolution of the ability that created it, for the duration specified by the effect. The effect continues to affect the game state for the specified duration regardless of whether the card that created the lasting effect is or remains in play.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a lasting effect affects in-play cards (or a specified set of cards), it is only applied to cards that are in play (or that meet the specifications of the set) at the time the lasting effect is established. Cards that enter play (or change status to meet the criteria of the specified set) after a lasting effect's establishment are not affected by that lasting effect.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A lasting effect expires as soon as the timing point specified by its duration is reached. This means that an "until the end of the phase" lasting effect expires before an "at the end of the phase" ability or delayed effect may initiate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A lasting effect that expires at the end of a specified time period can only be initiated during that time period.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Leaves Play</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                The phrase "leaves play" refers to any time a card makes a transition from an in-play state to an out-of-play destination.</p>
            <p>If a card leaves play, the following consequences occur simultaneously with the card leaving play:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All tokens on the card are returned to the general token pool.</li>
                <li>
                    All non-ancestral attachments on the card are discarded. All ancestral attachments on the card are returned to their owners' hands.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All lasting effects and/or delayed effects affecting the card while it was in play expire for that card.

            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Limited</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                Limited is a keyword ability. No more than one card in total with the limited keyword can be played by each player each round. Cards played from hand and played from a player's provinces are restricted by and count toward this limit.</p>
            <li>Limited cards that are "put into play" via card abilities ignore and are ignored by this restriction.

            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Limit X per [period]</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                This phrase specifies the number of times a triggered ability can be used during the designated period. This replaces the general restriction of using a triggered ability once per game round.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each copy of an ability with a specified limit may be used the specified number of times during the specified period.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a card leaves play and re-enters play during the same period, it is considered a new instance of the card and there is no memory of having used the ability during the specified period. (This rule also applies to any ability with no specified limit.)
                </li>
                <li>All limits are player specific.</li>
                <li>
                    If the effects of an ability with a limit are canceled, the use of the ability is still counted against the limit.

            <p>
                This phrase imposes a maximum number of times that an ability may be initiated from all copies (by title) of cards bearing the ability (including itself), during the designated period. Initiating an ability on a card counts toward the maximum for all copies of that card.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each maximum is player specific.</li>
                <li>
                    If the effects of a card or ability with a maximum are canceled, the use of the card or ability is still counted against the maximum.

            <p>
                The word "may" indicates that a specified player has the option to do that which follows. If no player is specified, the option is granted to the controller of the card with the ability in question.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Modifiers</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                Some abilities may ask players to modify values. The game state constantly checks and (if necessary) updates the count of any variable quantity that is being modified.</p>
            <p>
                Any time a new modifier is applied (or removed), the entire quantity is recalculated from the start, considering the unmodified base value and all active modifiers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The calculation of a value treats all modifiers as being applied simultaneously. However while performing the calculation, all additive and subtractive modifiers should be calculated before doubling and/or halving modifiers are calculated.
                </li>
                <li>Fractional values are rounded up after all modifiers have been applied.</li>
                <li>
                    When a value is "set" to a specific number, the set modifier overrides all non-set modifiers (including any new non-set modifiers that are added during the duration of the set value). If multiple set modifiers are in conflict, the most recently applied set modifier takes precedence.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A quantity cannot be reduced so that it functions with a value below zero: a card cannot have negative icons, political or military skill, glory, traits, cost, or keywords. Negative modifiers that would take a value below zero can be applied, but, after all active modifiers have been applied, any resultant value below zero is treated as zero.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Move</anchored-heading>
            <p>Some abilities allow players to move cards or tokens.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When an entity moves, it cannot move to its same (current) placement. If there is no valid destination for a move, the move attempt cannot be made.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When a character is moved into a conflict, that character is considered participating in the conflict on its controller's side.

            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Mulligan</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                During setup, each player has a single opportunity to mulligan any number of cards in his or her provinces, and a single opportunity to mulligan any number of cards in his or her hand. When a player decides to mulligan, the mulliganed cards are set aside, replaced with an equal number of cards from the top of the appropriate deck(s), and then shuffled back into the deck(s) from which they originated.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Players mulligan (or pass the opportunity to do so) in player order. If the first player passes an opportunity to mulligan, that player cannot change his or her mind and then decide to mulligan during that step after seeing the opponent's decision.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Nested Ability Sequences</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                Each time a triggering condition occurs, the following sequence is followed: (1) execute any interrupts to that triggering condition, (2) resolve the triggering condition itself, and then, (3) execute any reactions to that triggering condition.</p>
            <p>
                Within this sequence, if the use of an interrupt or reaction leads to a new triggering condition, the game pauses and starts a new sequence: (1) execute interrupts to the new triggering condition, (2) resolve the new triggering condition itself, and then, (3) execute reactions to the new triggering condition. This is called a nested sequence. Once this nested sequence is completed, the game returns to where it left off, continuing with the original triggering condition's sequence.</p>
            <p>
                It is possible that a nested sequence generates further triggering conditions (and hence more nested sequences). There is no limit to the number of nested sequences that may occur, but each nested sequence must complete before returning to the sequence that spawned it. In effect, these sequences are resolved in a Last In, First Out (LIFO) manner.</p>

                <li>If one or more traits precedes the word "attachments" (for example, "No <i>Weapon</i>
                    or <i>Armor</i>
                    attachments"), the card cannot have an attachment that possess one or more of the specified traits, but it can have attachments possessing none of those traits.

                <li>
                    If a participating character is bowed, it is still considered participating, but will not contribute its skill toward the resolution of the conflict while in a bowed state.

                    A character played directly into a conflict from a player's hand is participating in the conflict. The controller of the character must indicate that this is the case when the character is played.

                There are times in the game at which a player has an option to perform an act (such as taking an action, triggering an ability, or executing a game step), or to pass. Passing in such a situation forfeits the player's right to perform that act in that moment.</p>

                    The first player to pass the opportunity to use an action or play a card during the dynasty phase forfeits the opportunity to do so for the remainder of the phase, and gains one fate.

If the first player passes, and the second player does not, the opportunity returns to the first player in the sequence. The sequence only ends when both players have passed in succession.

            <p>
                Personal honor is a means of tracking the honored or dishonored status of individual character cards. Each character exists in one of three states:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Honored</li>
                <li>Ordinary</li>
                <li>Dishonored</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Characters enter play with ordinary status. Honored status tokens and dishonored status tokens are used to track the state of a character that receives a status other than ordinary.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When a character is honored, it receives an honored status token to indicate its honored status. An honored character adds its glory value to both its military and political skill so long as it possesses that token. When an honored character leaves play its controller gains 1 honor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When a character is dishonored, it receives a dishonored status token to indicate its dishonored status. A dishonored character subtracts its glory value from both its military and political skill so long as it possesses that token. When a dishonored character leaves play its controller loses 1 honor.

                    When an honored character is dishonored, it loses its honored status, discards the status token, and returns to ordinary status. Likewise, when a dishonored character is honored, it loses its dishonored status, discards the status token, and returns to ordinary status.

            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Play and Put into Play</anchored-heading>
            <p><b>Play</b>ing a character or attachment card involves paying the card's fate cost and placing the card in the play area. This causes the card to enter play. Cards are played from a player's hand or provinces. Any time a character card is played, its controller has the option of placing additional fate from his or her fate pool on the card.
            </p>
            <p>Some card abilities <b>put</b> cards <b>into play</b>. This bypasses the need to pay the card's cost, as well as the opportunity to place additional fate on the card. A card that is put into play bypasses any restrictions or prohibitions regarding the potential of playing that card. A card that is put into play enters play in its controller's play area.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A card that has been put into play is not considered to have been "played."</li>
                <li>In order to <i>play</i> a card, its fate cost (after modifiers) must be paid.</li>
                <li>When a card is <i>put into play</i>, its fate cost is ignored.</li>
                <li>
                    Unless otherwise instructed by the put into play effect, cards that enter play in this manner must do so in a play area or state that matches the rules of playing the card.

                <li>
                    When an event card is played, place it on the table, resolve its ability, and place the card in its owner's discard pile.

            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Play Restrictions and Permissions</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                Many cards or abilities contain specific instructions pertaining to when or how they may or may not be used, or to specific conditions that must be true in order to use them. In order to use such an ability or to play such a card, all play restrictions must be observed.</p>
            <p>
                A permission is a variant of a play restriction that provides a player with additional options as to how the card may be played or used, outside of the game's general specification regarding how the card or ability would normally be used.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Pride</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                Pride is a keyword ability. After a character with the pride keyword wins a conflict, honor that character. After a character with the pride keyword loses a conflict, dishonor that character.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Printed</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                The word printed refers to the text, characteristic, icon, or value that is physically printed on the card.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Priority of Simultaneous Resolution</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                If a single effect affects multiple players simultaneously, but the players must individually make choices to resolve the effect, the first player chooses first, followed by his or her opponent. Once all necessary choices have been made, the effect resolves simultaneously upon all affected entities.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If the resolution of two or more delayed effects or forced abilities would resolve at the same time, the first player decides the order in which the abilities resolve, regardless of who controls the cards bearing the conflicting abilities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If two or more constant abilities and/or lasting effects can be applied simultaneously, they are. If two or more constant abilities and/or lasting effects cannot be applied simultaneously, the first player determines the order in which they are applied.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Provinces, Province Cards</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                A player's provinces represent the lands surrounding his or her stronghold. When a province is under attack and turned faceup, the card represents what the enemy finds or encounters upon first entering that province.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A face-down province card is considered to be in play only as a face down province, and its faceup side is unable to engage with the game state until the province is revealed.
                </li>
                <li>A non-broken, faceup province is considered to be in play, and is engaged with the game state.</li>
                <li>A broken province is considered to have a blank text box, and its ability cannot be used.</li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Qualifiers</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                If card text includes a qualifier followed by multiple terms, the qualifier applies to each item in the list, if it is applicable. For example, in the phrase "each unique character and attachment," the word "unique" applies both to "character" and to "attachment."</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Reactions</anchored-heading>
            <p>A reaction is a triggered ability whose text is prefaced by a boldface "<b>Reaction:</b>" precursor. Always resolve a triggering condition before initiating any reactions to that triggering condition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike actions, which are resolved during action windows, a reaction may be initiated only if its specified triggering condition occurs, as described in the reaction ability's text.</p>
            <p>After a triggering condition resolves, a reaction window for that triggering condition opens.</p>
            <p>
                Within the reaction window, the first player always has the first opportunity to initiate an eligible reaction (to the triggering condition that opened the window), or pass. Opportunities to initiate an eligible reaction, or pass, continue to alternate between the players until all players consecutively pass, at which point the reaction window closes. Passing does not prevent a player from initiating an eligible reaction later in that same reaction window.</p>
            <p>
                Once a reaction window closes, further reactions to that specific triggering condition cannot be initiated.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Unless otherwise noted by the ability, each reaction ability may be initiated once each round. (This includes forced reactions.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    A reaction with a specified limit that enables it to be triggered more than once per round may only be initiated once each time its specified triggering condition occurs.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Ready</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                A card that is in an upright state so that its controller can read its text from left to right is considered ready.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The default state in which cards enter play is ready.</li>
                <li>A ready card is bowed by rotating it 90 degrees to the side.</li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Refill a Province</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                If a player is instructed to refill a province, that player takes the top card of his or her dynasty deck and places it facedown (without looking at it) on the province.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    After a card is removed from a province for any reason (and after all reaction opportunities to that card leaving the province are passed), a player automatically refills the province from which the card was removed if that province is still empty (i.e., if there is no dynasty card there).
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a player is instructed to refill a province faceup, the dynasty card is placed in the province faceup rather than facedown.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Removed from Game</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                "Removed from the game" is an out-of-play state. A card that has been removed from the game is set aside and has no further interaction with the game in any manner for the duration of its removal. If there is no specified duration, a card that has been removed from the game is considered removed until the end of the game.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Replacement Effects</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                A replacement effect is an effect (usually an interrupt) that replaces the resolution of a triggering condition with a different means of resolving the same triggering condition, but in such a manner that the triggering condition is still considered to occur. The word "instead" is frequently indicative of such an effect. After all interrupts to the triggering condition have resolved and it is time to resolve the triggering condition itself, the replacement effect resolves instead.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If multiple replacement effects are initiated against the same triggering condition, the most recently initiated replacement effect is the one used for the resolution of the triggering condition.
                </li>

            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Restricted</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                Restricted is a keyword ability. A character may not have more than two attachments with the restricted keyword attached to it at any time.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If at any time a character has three or more restricted attachments, that character's controller must immediately choose and discard one of the restricted attachments on the character as soon as the illegal game state occurs.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Reveal</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                When a player is instructed to reveal cards, that player is required to show those cards to his or her opponent to that opponent's satisfaction. If there is no specified duration for the reveal, the cards remain revealed until they reach a new destination (as specified by the ability), or through the ability's resolution.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    While a card is revealed, it is still considered to be located in the game area (such as a player's hand or deck) from which it is revealed.

            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Rings</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                Rings, represented by double-sided tokens, are used to determine the type and element of conflicts. Each ring exists in one of three states, as follows:</p>
            <p><b>Unclaimed</b>
                &ndash;
                Each ring in the unclaimed ring pool is an unclaimed ring, and is eligible to be selected by a player as a part of the process of declaring a conflict.
            </p>
            <p><b>Contested</b>
                &ndash;
                While a conflict is resolving, the ring that has been selected by the attacker when the conflict was declared is placed on the attacked province. This ring is known as the contested ring.
            </p>
            <p><b>Claimed</b>
                &ndash;
                When a player wins a conflict, that player claims the contested ring and places it into his or her claimed ring pool.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each claimed ring adds 1 to the glory count of the player who controls it.</li>
                <li>During the fate phase, place 1 fate on each unclaimed ring.</li>
                <li>
                    When a ring becomes the contested ring in a conflict, move all fate on that ring to the attacking player's fate pool.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Ring Effects</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                Each time a player wins a conflict as the attacking player, he or she may resolve the ring effect associated with the contested ring's element. The ring effects are as follows:</p>
            <p><b>Air</b>: The attacking player takes 1 honor from his or her opponent, or gains 2 honor from the general token pool.
            </p>
            <p><b>Earth</b>: The attacking player draws 1 card from his or her conflict deck and discards 1 card at random from his or her opponent's hand.
            </p>
            <p><b>Fire</b>: The attacking player chooses a character in play and chooses to honor or dishonor that character.
            </p>
            <p><b>Water</b>: The attacking player either chooses a character and readies it, or chooses a character with no fate on it and bows it.
            </p>
            <p><b>Void</b>: The attacking player chooses a character and removes 1 fate from that character.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Whenever a player resolves a ring effect for a ring that has multiple elements, that player may choose among those elements when the conflict's ring effect resolves.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Role Cards</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                A role card is placed alongside a player's stronghold, and provides specialized abilities and limitations for that player's deck. A player may use a single role card in conjunction with his or her stronghold while assembling a deck. The role card starts the game next to its owner's stronghold and is revealed along with the stronghold during setup.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Role cards are not considered in play. Their text affects the game state from the out-of-play area while they are active beside a player's stronghold.
                </li>
                <li>Cards with the printed role cardtype cannot be removed from the game by other card abilities.</li>
                <li>
                    In sanctioned tournament play, role card eligibility for each clan is determined by the Emperor's Sanction list, which is established through player participation.

            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Running Out of Cards</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                If a player attempts to replace a card on a province from his or her dynasty deck or draw a card from his or her conflict deck and no cards remain in the deck, that player loses 5 honor, then shuffles the corresponding discard pile and places it facedown to form a new dynasty or conflict deck. That player then continues to replace the dynasty card or draw the conflict card.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Sacrifice</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                When a player is instructed to sacrifice a card, that player must select a card in play that he or she controls and that matches the requirements of the sacrifice, and place it in his or her discard pile.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the selected card does not leave play, the sacrifice is not considered to have been made.</li>
                <li>Sacrificing a card does not satisfy other means (such as "discard") of a card leaving play.</li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Search</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                When a player is instructed to search for a card, that player is permitted to look at all of the cards in the searched area without revealing those cards to his or her opponent.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If an effect searches an entire deck, the deck must be shuffled to the satisfaction of the opponent upon completion of the search.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A player is not obliged to find the object of a search effect, even if the searched cards contain a card that meets the eligibility requirements of the search.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a search effect would add a card with specified characteristics to a hidden game area, the player fulfilling the search must reveal the card to his or her opponent to verify that the card is eligible to be found by the search.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While a game area (or a part of a game area) is being searched, the cards being searched are considered to still be in that game area.

            <p>
                When a card's ability text refers to itself ("this character," "this province," etc.), the text is referring to that copy only, and not to other copies (by title) of the card.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Setup</anchored-heading>
            <p>To set up a game, perform the following steps in order:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Select decks</b>. Each player selects a deck using the deckbuilding rules. See "<a
                        href="#deckbuilding">Deckbuilding</a>" on page 5.
                </li>
                <li><b>Create token bank and unclaimed ring pool</b>. Place all fate tokens, honor tokens, status tokens, and the Imperial Favor in a pile within reach of each player. This area is known as the token bank. Place the rings near the token bank. This area is known as the unclaimed ring pool.
                </li>
                <li><b>Determine first player</b>. Randomly select a player. That player will be the first player. Place the first player token in front of this player. The player that is not randomly selected to be the first player gains 1 fate from the general token pool and adds it to their fate pool.
                </li>
                <li><b>Shuffle dynasty and conflict decks</b>. Each player shuffles both their dynasty and conflict decks separately and presents them to the opponent for additional shuffling and/or a final cut. Then each player places their dynasty deck to the left of their play area and their conflict deck to the right.
                </li>
                <li><b>Place provinces and stronghold</b>. In player order, each player secretly selects one of their provinces, places it facedown above their dynasty deck, and places their stronghold card on top of it. If a player is using a role card, it is placed next to his or her stronghold during this step. Each player then places their other four provinces facedown between their dynasty and conflict decks, in any order.
                </li>
                <li><b>Fill provinces</b>. Each player places a card from the top of their dynasty deck facedown onto each of their empty nonstronghold provinces. In player order, each player has one opportunity to look at each of his or her cards placed in this manner and mulligan any number of them.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Note:</b> After this step, a player may not look at facedown cards in his or her provinces.

                </ul>

            <p>
                The word "shuffle" is used as a shorthand that instructs a player to shuffle a deck that was just searched. When a player is instructed to shuffle, only shuffle the deck or decks that were affected by the ability.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each time a deck is shuffled, it must be randomized to the satisfaction of the opponent, and upon completion of the shuffle presented to the opponent for additional shuffling and/or a final cut.

            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Skill</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                A character's effectiveness in various endeavors is measured by its skill. There are two types of skill in the game, military skill and political skill.</p>
            <p>Military skill (<span class="icon icon-conflict-military"></span>) is used to determine the victor during military conflicts.
            </p>
            <p>Political skill (<span class="icon icon-conflict-political"></span>) is used to determine the victor during political conflicts.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Total attacking skill is the sum of each ready participating character's skill (for the appropriate conflict type) on the attacking player's side, plus any relevant modifiers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Total defending skill is the sum of each ready participating character's skill (for the appropriate conflict type) on the defending player's side, plus any relevant modifiers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A player is not able to win a conflict if that player has a total attacking or defending skill of zero.

            <p>A player's stronghold is considered in play. A stronghold card cannot leave play, <span class="new">move from the stronghold province, be turned facedown</span>, or change control.

            <p>
                Some abilities use the word "switch." In order to use such an ability, switched items must exist on each side of the switch.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Take</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                If a player is instructed to take a token (such as honor or fate) from another player, that element is removed from the other player's token pool and added to the taking player's token pool.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Target</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                The word "choose" indicates that one or more targets must be chosen in order for an ability to resolve. The player resolving the effect must choose a game element (usually a card) that meets the targeting requirements of the ability.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The controller of a targeting ability chooses all targets for the effect unless otherwise specified by the card.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If an ability requires the choosing of one or more targets, and there are not enough valid targets to meet all of its targeting requirements, the ability cannot be initiated. This initiation check is made at the same time the ability's play restrictions are checked.
                </li>
                <li>
                    At the time targets are chosen, any currently valid targets are eligible to be chosen. (This choice is not restricted only to targets that were present during the initiation check.)
                </li>
                <li>If multiple targets are required to be chosen by the same player, these are chosen simultaneously.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An ability that can choose "any number" of targets does not successfully resolve (and cannot change the game state) if zero of those targets are chosen. If there are zero eligible targets for an ability that can choose "any number" of targets, the ability cannot initiate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The resolution of some effects (such as post-then effects, or delayed effects) requires that targets are chosen after the initiation of the effect. Such targets need not be verified when checking play restrictions and determining whether or not the entire ability may initiate. If there are no valid targets at the time such targets would be chosen, that aspect of the effect fails to resolve.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A card is not an eligible target for an ability if the resolution of that ability's effect could not affect the target at all. <em>(For example, a bowed character cannot be chosen as the target for an ability that reads "<b>Action:</b>
                    Choose a character &ndash; bow that character.")</em></li>
                <li>
                    Some abilities require the choice of a target that is not directly affected by the ability &ndash; the target is instead chosen as a reference point while resolving the ability. When choosing referential targets, a player is not bound by the rule that a target is ineligible if the resolution of the effect would not affect the chosen target.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">The word "Then"</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                If the effect text of a card ability includes the word "then," the text preceding the word then must be successfully resolved in full (i.e. the game state must change to reflect the intent of the pre-then aspect of the effect in its entirety) before the remainder of the effect described after the word "then" can be resolved.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If the pre-then aspect of an effect does successfully resolve in full, the resolution of the post-then aspect of the effect must also attempt to resolve.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the pre-then aspect of an effect does not successfully resolve in full, the post-then aspect does not attempt to resolve.

            </ul>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Token Pool, General Token Pool</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                The token pool (also referred to as the general token pool) is created during setup and contains all of the tokens and counters not currently controlled by any player.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When a player gains fate or honor, that fate or honor is taken from the token pool and added to that player's fate or honor pool. When a player spends or loses fate or honor, those tokens are returned to the token pool.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When a card with any tokens or counters on it leaves play, those tokens and counters are returned to the token pool.
                </li>

            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Tokens, Running Out of</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                There is no limit to the number of fate, honor, and personal status tokens which can be in the game area at a given time. If players run out of the provided tokens, other tokens, counters, or coins may be used to track the game state.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Traits</anchored-heading>
            <p>Most cards have one or more traits listed at the top of the text box and printed in <i>Bold Italics</i>.

            <ul>
                <li><i>Traits</i>
                    have no inherent effect on the game. Instead, some card abilities reference cards that possess specific traits.

            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Triggered Abilities</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                A boldface timing command followed by a colon indicates that an ability is a triggered ability. Triggered abilities fall into one of the following types: actions, interrupts, and reactions. Some interrupt and reaction abilities are also forced.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Unless the timing command is prefaced by the word "Forced," all triggered abilities are optional. They can be triggered (or not) by their controller at the ability's appropriate timing point. Forced triggered abilities are triggered automatically by the game at the ability's appropriate timing point.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unless otherwise specified by the ability itself, each triggered ability may be triggered once per round.
                </li>
                <li>Triggered abilities are written in a <em>"triggering condition (and/or) cost (and/or) targeting requirements &ndash; effect"</em>
                    template. Ability text before the dash consists of triggering conditions (and/or) costs (and/or) targeting requirements. Ability text after the dash consists of effects. and may sometimes include targeting requirements that come into play as the effect is being resolved.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a triggered ability has no dash, the ability has no pre-dash content, and the entirety of the ability is considered an effect.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A triggered ability can only be initiated if its effect has the potential to change the game state on its own. This potential is assessed without taking into account the consequences of the cost payment or any other ability interactions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A triggered ability can only be initiated if its cost (after modifiers) has the potential to be paid in full.

            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Triggering Condition</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                A triggering condition is a specific occurrence that takes place in the game. On card abilities, the triggering condition is the element of the ability that references such an occurrence, indicating the timing point at which the ability may be used. The description of an ability's triggering condition often follows the word "when" (for interrupt abilities) or the word "after" (for reaction abilities).</p>
            <p>
                If a single occurrence creates multiple triggering conditions (such as a single Earth ring effect causing a player to draw a card and another player to discard a card), those triggering conditions are handled in shared interrupt/reaction windows, in which abilities that refer to any of the triggering conditions created by that occurrence may be used in any order.</p>
            <p>
                The following is a sequence of possible interrupt and reaction opportunities that exists around each triggering condition that may arise in a game:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The triggering condition becomes imminent. (In other words, if it is not canceled, changed, or otherwise preempted by interrupt abilities, the triggering condition is the next thing that will occur in the game.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Interrupt abilities that reference when the imminent triggering condition "would" occur may be used. (<b>Note</b>: For effects, a "cancel" interrupt may prevent the effect from initiating, and the initiation of the effect is a separate triggering condition that precedes the effect's resolution. "Cancel" interrupts are the only type that will reference the initiation of an effect.) If the imminent triggering condition is canceled, none of the subsequent steps in this sequence occur. If the triggering condition is changed, the original condition is no longer imminent, but the new triggering condition is now imminent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Forced interrupts that reference the imminent triggering condition must resolve, in the order determined by the first player. The standard interrupt window to the imminent triggering condition opens. It closes after all players consecutively pass.
                </li>
                <li>The triggering condition itself occurs.</li>
                <li>
                    Forced reactions that reference the triggering condition must resolve, in the order determined by the first player.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The reaction window to the triggering condition opens. It closes after all players consecutively pass.

            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Unique Cards</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                A card with the ◦ symbol in front of its title is a unique card. Each player may only have a maximum of one instance of each unique card, by title, in play.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A player cannot take control of or bring into play a unique card if he or she already controls or owns an in-play copy of that card.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As a player action during the dynasty phase, a player may discard a copy (by title) of a unique character from his or her hand or provinces to place 1 fate on an in-play copy of that unique character he or she controls.

                <li>
                    Each time the defending player loses an unopposed conflict, that player loses 1 honor. The lost honor is returned to the general token pool. This occurs during framework <a

            <ul>
                <li>
                    A player's total skill is the sum of the skill matching the conflict type of each ready participating character on his or her side of the conflict, along with any other modifiers that are affecting the amount of skill the player counts for the conflict.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A player must count at least 1 total skill and there must be at least one participating character on his or her side in order to win a conflict.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the total skill counted on each side is tied at a value of 1 or greater (and the attacking player controls at least one participating character), the attacking player wins the conflict.

                <li>
                    If neither player can meet the requirements of winning a conflict, neither player wins (or loses) that conflict. When this occurs, return the contested ring to the unclaimed ring pool.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some card abilities reference a character "winning" a conflict. In order for a character to be considered to have "won" a conflict, that character must be participating in the conflict on the winning side at the time the ability resolves.

                <li>
                    The first player to have 0 honor in his or her honor pool is eliminated from the game, causing that player's opponent to win.

                The word "would" is used to define the triggering condition of some interrupt abilities, and establishes a higher priority for those abilities than interrupts to the same triggering condition that lack the word "would."</p>

                All "would be X" interrupts are eligible to be used before any "is X" interrupts.

                <li>
                    If an interrupt to a triggering condition that would occur changes the nature of that which is about to occur, no further interrupts to the original triggering condition may be used, as that triggering condition is no longer imminent.

                boxes are known as framework steps. Framework steps are mandatory occurrences dictated by the structure of the game. <i>Purple</i>
                windows are special framework steps that indicate the possibility of the game returning to an earlier framework step in the chart. These repetitive sequences can end in various ways, such as when all players have performed the steps in a sequence, or when a player makes a specific decision. Each purple window explains when and how the game either loops back or progresses to a later framework step.
            </p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Action Windows</anchored-heading>
            <p>An action ability may only be triggered during an action window. Action windows are presented in lighter <i>orange</i>
                boxes on the chart. When most action windows open, the first player has the first opportunity to initiate an action, or pass. The one exception to this is the action window during the conflict phase, in which the defending player has the first opportunity to initiate an action, or pass. Opportunities to initiate actions alternate between the players in player order until all players consecutively pass, at which point the action window closes and the game advances to the next step on the timing chart. Note that if a player passes his or her opportunity to act, but the other opponent does not consecutively pass in sequence, the original player may still take an action when the alternation of action opportunities returns to the player who had passed.
            </p>
            <p>Resolve each action completely before the next action opportunity.</p>
            <p>
                During each action window, players are permitted to play character and attachment cards from hand. The one exception to this is step 1.4, during which playing character and attachment cards from hand is prohibited.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">Reactions and Interrupts</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                A reaction ability to a framework effect may be initiated immediately after the completion of any framework step.</p>
            <p>
                An interrupt ability to a framework effect may be initiated during the resolution of that step, interrupting the process of that step.</p>

                Each of the following entries corresponds to the framework step of the same number on the Phase Sequence Timing Chart.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">1. Dynasty Phase</anchored-heading>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">1.1. Dynasty phase begins</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                This step formalizes the beginning of the dynasty phase. As this is the first framework step of the round, it also formalizes the beginning of a new game round.</p>
            <p>
                The beginning of a phase is an important game milestone that may be referenced in card text, either as a point at which an ability may or must resolve, or as a point at which a lasting effect or constant ability begins or expires.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">1.2. Reveal facedown dynasty cards</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                In player order, each player turns each facedown dynasty card in each of his or her provinces faceup. A player's cards are turned over one at a time, from the player's leftmost province to his or her rightmost province.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">1.3. Collect fate</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                In player order, each player collects fate equal to the fate value on his or her stronghold card, incorporating all active fate modifiers. This fate is taken from the general token pool and added to the player's fate pool.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">1.4. Play cards from provinces</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                This is a special action window in which the opportunity to act alternates back and forth between the players, in player order.</p>
            <p>With his or her opportunity to act, a player may do one of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play one character from his or her provinces.</li>
                <li>Trigger an eligible action ability.</li>
                <li>
                    Discard a duplicate of a character from his or her hand or from one of his or her provinces to place 1 fate on a copy of that character under his or her control.
                </li>
                <li>Pass.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>NOTE</b>: During this window, a player is not permitted to play character or attachment cards from his or her hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                To play a character from a province, a player removes a number of fate equal to the character's fate cost from his or her fate pool, and returns that fate to the general token pool. The character enters play and is placed in the player's home area. The player then has the option to place any number of additional fate from his or her fate pool onto that character. Once this option to place additional fate has been completed or passed, the province from which the character was played is refilled facedown from the dynasty deck.</p>
            <p>
                When a player passes, that player relinquishes all further opportunities to act during this phase. (A player who has passed may still trigger interrupts and reactions to any eligible occurrence.) The player to pass first gains 1 fate from the general token pool and adds it to his or her fate pool. After one player has passed, the other player may continue to use action opportunities until he or she also passes. Once both players have passed, this step is complete.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">1.5. Dynasty phase ends</anchored-heading>
            <p>This step formalizes the end of the dynasty phase.</p>
            <p>
                The end of a phase is an important game milestone that may be referenced in card text, either as a point at which an ability may or must resolve, or as a point at which a lasting effect or constant ability expires or begins.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">2. Draw Phase</anchored-heading>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">2.1. Draw phase begins</anchored-heading>

            <p>
                Each player secretly selects a number from 1 to 5 on his or her honor dial as his or her honor bid for this round. Once both players have confirmed that they are ready, proceed to the next step.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">2.3. Reveal honor dials</anchored-heading>
            <p>The players simultaneously reveal their bids.</p>
            <p>
                Once a player reveals an honor bid, the dial is placed next to the player's stronghold and remains as a reference point until the next honor bid occurs.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">2.4. Transfer honor</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                The player with the higher honor bid must give an amount of honor to the player with the lower honor bid that is equal to the difference between the two bids. If the bids are equal, no honor is transferred during this step.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">2.5. Draw cards</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                Each player simultaneously draws X cards from his or her conflict deck. For each player, X is equal to his or her honor bid.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">2.6. Draw phase ends</anchored-heading>
            <p>This step formalizes the end of the draw phase.</p>

            <p>This step formalizes the beginning of the conflict phase.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">3.2. Declare conflict</anchored-heading>
            <p>(Shares 3.2 with conflict resolution chart.)</p>
            <p>
                During the conflict phase, each player is granted one opportunity to declare a military conflict and one opportunity to declare a political conflict. These conflict opportunities alternate between players with remaining conflict opportunities in player order until each player has declared a conflict or passed on each of his or her conflict opportunities. A player's military and political conflicts may be declared in either order during the round.</p>
            <p>When a player has an opportunity to declare a conflict, that player may:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Declare a military conflict, or pass the opportunity to do so.</li>
                <li>Declare a political conflict, or pass the opportunity to do so.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If a specific conflict opportunity is passed, the player forfeits his or her right to use that opportunity this phase.</p>
            <p>In order to declare a conflict, the attacking player must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Declare the type and element of the conflict to be initiated. This is indicated by selecting a ring from the unclaimed ring pool (this ring is known as the contested ring, and defines the element of the conflict), and placing it on an opponent's eligible unbroken province (this indicates which province is being attacked) with either the military side or the political side faceup (the faceup side of the contested ring defines the type of the conflict).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If a player selects an unclaimed ring with fate on it to become the contested ring, that fate is moved from the ring to the attacking player's fate pool.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Declare which <i>ready</i>
                    characters (under his or her control) are being committed as attackers. The attacking player may declare any number of eligible characters under his or her control as attackers. Slide these characters toward the center of the play area, away from the attacking player's home area. At least one character must be declared as an attacker at this time in order to initiate a conflict. If any of the attackers have the covert keyword, the targets for covert are chosen at this time.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Each of the above items are considered to be performed simultaneously. If any of the above cannot be completed, the conflict cannot be initiated.</p>
            <p>
                If the province being attacked is facedown, turn it faceup as soon as a conflict is successfully declared against it. This occurs before any reactions to the process of conflict declaration may be triggered.</p>
            <p>Once a conflict has been declared, resolve that conflict before the next conflict is declared.</p>
            <p>If no player has a conflict opportunity remaining when this step is reached, advance to step 3.4.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">3.2.1. Declare defenders</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                The defending player declares which &ndash; if any &ndash; ready characters (under his or her control) are being committed as defenders. The defending player may declare any number of eligible characters under his or her control as defenders. Slide these characters toward the center of the play area, away from the defending player's home area. Declaring "no defenders" is also an option.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">3.2.2. Conflict action window</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                This is a special action window in which the defending player (rather than the first player) has the first action opportunity. These opportunities then alternate between the players until both players consecutively pass.</p>
            <p>With an action opportunity, a player may:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Activate an eligible action ability on a card he or she controls.</li>
                <li>Play an event card with an action trigger from his or her hand.</li>
                <li>Play an attachment card from hand, and attach it to any eligible character in play.</li>
                <li>
                    Play a character from hand, into the conflict, participating on that player's side. (Additional fate from the player's fate pool may be placed on the character at this time.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Play a character from hand into his or her home area. (Additional fate from the player's fate pool may be placed on the character at this time.)
                </li>
                <li>Pass.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After using an action opportunity, a player must announce the total relevant skill present on both sides of the conflict that would be counted if the conflict were to resolve with no further actions.</p>
            <p>Once both players consecutively pass their action opportunities, proceed to the next step.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">3.2.3. Compare skill values</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                The conflict type indicates which skill value is used to resolve the conflict. During a military conflict use military skill. During a political conflict use political skill.</p>
            <p>
                First, determine the attacking player's total skill in the conflict by adding together the skill (that matches the conflict type) of each ready attacking character and factor in all active modifiers. Then determine the defending player's total skill in the conflict by adding together the skill (that matches the conflict type) of each ready defending character and factor in all active modifiers.</p>
            <p>
                The player whose side has the higher total skill wins the conflict. In order to win a conflict, a player must count a total skill of 1 or higher. In the case of a tie, the conflict is won by the attacking player. If both players count 0 skill, the conflict resolves with no winner, and the ring is returned to the pool of unclaimed rings.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">3.2.4. Apply unopposed</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                If the attacking player won the conflict and the defending player controls no participating characters (in step 3.2.3), the conflict is considered "unopposed." The defending player loses 1 honor and returns it to the general token pool.</p>
            <p>If the defending player or no player won the conflict, nothing happens during this step.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">3.2.5. Break province</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                If the attacking player won the conflict by an amount equal to or greater than the strength of the attacked province (in step 3.2.3), the province is broken. Rotate the province 180 degrees to indicate this.</p>
            <p>
                If the attacking player wins a conflict and breaks a province, he or she may immediately discard any dynasty card on that province. The card is replaced facedown from its controller's dynasty deck.</p>
            <p>If the defending player or no player won the conflict, nothing happens during this step.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">3.2.6. Resolve ring effects</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                If the attacking player won the conflict (in step 3.2.3), that player may resolve the ring effect of the contested ring. The ring effects are as follows:</p>
            <p><b>Air</b>: The attacking player takes 1 honor from his or her opponent, or gains 2 honor from the general token pool.
            </p>
            <p><b>Earth</b>: The attacking player draws 1 card from his or her conflict deck and discards 1 card at random from his or her opponent's hand.
            </p>
            <p><b>Fire</b>: The attacking player chooses a character in play, and chooses to honor or dishonor that character.
            </p>
            <p><b>Water</b>: The attacker either chooses a character and readies it, or chooses a character with no fate on it and bows it.
            </p>
            <p><b>Void</b>: The attacking player chooses a character and removes 1 fate from that character.</p>
            <p>If the defending player or no player won the conflict, nothing happens during this step.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">3.2.7. Claim ring</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                The player who won the conflict (in step 3.2.3) claims the contested ring and adds it to his or her claimed ring pool.</p>
            <p>If no player won the conflict (in step 3.2.3), the ring is returned to the unclaimed ring pool.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">3.2.8. Return home</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                Simultaneously bow each ready participating character in the conflict. Return each participating character to its controller's home area. These characters are no longer participating in the conflict.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">3.3. Conflict ends / Conflict was passed</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                This step formalizes the end of a conflict, or that a conflict opportunity has been passed. Return to the action window following step 3.1.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">3.4. Determine Imperial Favor</anchored-heading>
            <p>This step marks the beginning of the contest for the Imperial Favor.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">3.4.1. Glory count</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                Each player counts the total glory value of all ready characters he or she controls, factors in all active modifiers, and adds 1 to this count for each ring in his or her claimed ring pool.</p>
            <p>
                The players then compare their totals. The player with the higher total wins the glory count. If the totals are tied, neither player wins the glory count.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">3.4.2. Claim Imperial favor</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                The player who won the glory count (in step 3.4.1) claims the Imperial Favor by taking the Imperial Favor card, setting it to its military side or to its political side, and placing it next to his or her stronghold. That player is said to "have the Imperial Favor," and the card may influence the following game round. If a player who already has the Imperial Favor claims it again, the player may set it to either side.</p>
            <p>
                If players have the same total, the Imperial Favor remains in its current state (either unclaimed or under the possession of the player who currently has it, remaining set on its current side).</p>
            <p>This step also marks the end of the contest for the Imperial Favor.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">3.5. Conflict phase ends</anchored-heading>
            <p>This step formalizes the end of the conflict phase.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">4. Fate Phase</anchored-heading>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">4.1. Fate phase begins</anchored-heading>
            <p>This step formalizes the beginning of the fate phase.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">4.2. Discard characters with no fate</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                In player order, each player discards each character he or she controls with no fate on it. These characters are discarded one at a time, in the order of the discarding player's choosing.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">4.3. Remove fate from characters</anchored-heading>
            <p>Simultaneously remove 1 fate from each character in play.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">4.4. Place fate on unclaimed rings</anchored-heading>
            <p>Simultaneously place 1 fate from the general token pool on each unclaimed ring.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">4.5. Fate phase ends</anchored-heading>
            <p>This step formalizes the end of the fate phase.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="2">5. Regroup Phase</anchored-heading>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">5.1. Regroup phase begins</anchored-heading>
            <p>This step formalizes the beginning of the regroup phase.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">5.2. Ready cards</anchored-heading>
            <p>Simultaneously ready each bowed card in play.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">5.3. Discard from provinces</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                In player order, each player must discard each faceup card from each his or her broken provinces, and also has the opportunity to choose and discard any number of faceup dynasty cards from his or her unbroken provinces.</p>
            <p>Each card discarded in this manner is replaced facedown from its owner's dynasty deck.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">5.4. Return rings</anchored-heading>
            <p>Simultaneously return each claimed ring to the unclaimed ring pool.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">5.5. Pass first player token</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                The player with the first player token passes it to his or her opponent. That player becomes the first player.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">5.6. Regroup phase ends</anchored-heading>
            <p>This step formalizes the end of the regroup phase.</p>
            <p>
                As the regroup phase is the final phase in the round, this step also formalizes the end of the round. Any active "until the end of the round" lasting effects expire at this time.</p>
            <p>
                After this step is complete, play proceeds to the beginning of the dynasty phase of the next game round.</p>

            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">D.1. Duel begins</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                A duel is initiated by the successful resolution of any action ability that challenges another character to a duel. When such an ability resolves, this timing window opens.</p>
            <p>This step formalizes the beginning of the duel.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">D.2. Establish challenger and challengee</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                The ability that initiated the duel (in step D.1) will have identified two characters that are involved in the duel. The character controlled by the player who initiated the ability is the challenger. The character controlled by his or her opponent is the challengee.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">D.3. Duel honor bid</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                Each player secretly selects a number from 1 to 5 on his or her honor dial as his or her honor bid for this duel. Once both players have confirmed that they are ready, proceed to the next step.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">D.4. Reveal honor dials</anchored-heading>
            <p>The players simultaneously reveal their bids.</p>
            <p>
                Once a player reveals an honor bid, the dial is placed next to the player's stronghold and remains as a reference point until the next honor bid occurs.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">D.5. Transfer honor</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                The player with the higher honor bid must give an amount of honor to the player with the lower honor bid that is equal to the difference between the two bids. If the bids are equal, no honor is transferred during this step.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">D.6. Modify dueling skill</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                The ability that initiated the duel (in step D.1) established which type of skill (military or political) is being used to determine the results of the duel. Each player adds his or her honor bid to the specified skill of his or her character that is involved in the duel. This modification persists until the end of the duel.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>NOTE</b>: Any skill modifiers that were active at the time the duel was initiated are still applicable during the duel.

                <li>The player controlling the character with the higher skill value wins the duel.</li>
                <li>The player controlling the character with the lower skill value loses the duel.</li>
                <li>If the skill values are the same, neither player wins the duel, and neither player loses the duel.
                </li>

            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">D.8. Apply duel results</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                The ability that initiated the duel (in step D.1) specified the consequences of this duel for the winning and/or losing characters, or for the player(s) controlling those characters. Apply those consequences during this step.</p>
            <anchored-heading @heading="add" :level="3">D.9. Duel ends</anchored-heading>
            <p>
                This step formalizes the end of the duel. Return to the action window in which the duel was initiated, with the next player in the sequence of actions having the next opportunity to act.</p>
            <p><b>NOTE</b>: There are no action windows during a duel, so players are not able to initiate actions or play characters and attachments from their hands during the resolution of a duel. Applicable interrupt and/or reaction abilities may be triggered during a duel.
